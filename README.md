# FlipPhone

FlipPhone is a used phone marketplace app that improves on existing marketplace apps by standardizing the listing process and automating areas where sellers are frequently lazy or vague when posting. FlipPhone ensures accuracy in the description of the phone's hardware that buyers rely on by using contextual boundaries and defined instructions.

One of the app's key features is the use of QR codes generated by the device being sold and scanned into the "new" phone, which eliminates inconsistencies in the phone's hardware description. This feature allows sellers to create listings in a seamless and efficient manner, while also providing buyers with accurate and reliable information about the phone they're interested in purchasing.
